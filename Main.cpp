//Evemtually I'll run all the files through here.
//I'll get rid of each of their int mains, and replace them with a single point here
//I'll make them all classes and give them headers
//I'll call those headers here
//If I'm feel fancy I'll take user input, repeatedly until the user gives me the input I want, and then run one of the files based on that input 
  //Probably like a switch statement on int.  Numbers 0 through however many indicating which class to call.
//Once the program has run I'll close the program.  
  //MAYBE if I'm feeling fancy I'll ask the user to type quit, otherwise let them pick another number, but that's not important.
